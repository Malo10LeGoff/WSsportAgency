# This is a template for the website of a sport Agency. It is a very basic static website composed of only one page

How to preview it ?

1. Clone the repository on your computer

2. With your favorite code editor (I'm using VS code), open index.html in browser. For VSCode users, I am using the plugin Live server. You just have to install it then right click on your index.html, it should open in your browser.
